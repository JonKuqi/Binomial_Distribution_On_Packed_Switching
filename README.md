# Packet_Switching_Evaluator_Using_AI

### This program calculates the probability of encountering errors during Packet Switching, and based on the description of the area, using AI, determines if the communication is successful.

## Features  
- **Error Probability Calculation**  
  - Uses Binomial distribution and Pearson correlation to compute the probability of encountering errors during packet switching.  

- **Space Importance Assessment**  
  - Utilizes Llama AI prompting to analyze the described WiFi coverage area and determine its importance.  

- **Connection Success Evaluation**  
  - Combines error probability and space importance results to predict if the WiFi connection will be successful.  

## Usage  
- **Input Packet Switching Data**
   - Provide the number of packets and errors to calculate the probability of encountering an error.

- **Describe WiFi Coverage Area**
   - Enter a description of the area where the WiFi will be used, such as its size, usage density, and significance.

- **View Combined Results**
   - The program will combine the error probability and area importance to determine whether the connection is likely to be successful
 
## Project is made using Python
