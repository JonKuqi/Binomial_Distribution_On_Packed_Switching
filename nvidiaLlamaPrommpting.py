        I am working on a system that models the performance of network environments using the concept of Packet Switching. 
        The higher the probability of many users being active at once, the more network congestion there is likely to be.
        In environments where network stability is critical (such as a university), 
        a high probability of simultaneous user activity is **not good** because it could cause delays or slowdowns in important tasks like accessing educational resources or completing academic work.
        Conversely, in environments where immediate access to the network is less critical (such as a cafÃ©), 
        the system may tolerate higher user activity because people may be using the network more casually, 
        like for entertainment or casual browsing.  
        Even if there is a delay in packet switching, it would not have a serious impact on most users. 
        Considering that 0 is not important and 1 is very important. 
        Return me a number between 0 to 1 with a precision past the decimal point of 2, which indicates on how important is for people in an environment to not be disturbed by delaying internet.
